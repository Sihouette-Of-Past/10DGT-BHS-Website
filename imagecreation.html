            It is a very cool topic.<br> <br> With Gimp, we acquired skills such as removing the background of an image, changing its opacity and colour, and using layers to arrange them aesthetically. It is very useful, not only for matters like putting a teacher on a book with a whale swimming in the sky, but also for creating the most hilarious birthday cards. I suppose it helps slightly when it comes to having a career that involves photoshopping, like an editer. <br><br>
            Inkscape was, unlike what my auto-type AI suggested, a very rewarding experience. We learned to use various tools, like biezer lines, fill/stokes, gradients, and more. I enjoyed this as it made creating high quality digital art easier. It is also useful in other areas of life such as drawing your sister and personalising stickers. As for ways to extend this, I could design the sprites of my game with this skill, or even make my Term 4 project with it.
